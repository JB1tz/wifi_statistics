DESCRIPTION
===========

This Linux kernel module tracks stations on a 802.11 monitor interface
and collects various statistics. This might be useful to assess link qualities,
find out which stations are in range or are interfering, etc.

BUILD
=====

To compile against your currently installed  kernel, just type:

# make

if you want to compile against some other kernel, use:

# make KERNELPATH=/path/to/kernel

USAGE
=====
Usage:

1. Create monitor device mon0, for example by doing:
	iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor flags control fcsfail
	ifconfig mon0 up
2. insmod wifi-statistics.ko 
3. cat /sys/kernel/debug/wifi_statistics/stats 

Optional:
echo "read" > /sys/kernel/debug/wifi_statistics/mode
or
echo "reset" > /sys/kernel/debug/wifi_statistics/mode

The reset mode is similar to the read mode, deletes all
stations from the internal database when reading.
In read mode, the internal database is not modified.
